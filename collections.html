      <h2 id="modal-title">Sunstone Amulet — Collection Note</h2>
      <p>
        The Sunstone Amulet is a small circular disc, approximately 5 cm in diameter, crafted from polished sunstone with delicate copper wire inlay. 
        Dating to 1200–1000 BCE, it was discovered in a burial mound in central Scandinavia alongside bronze beads and a small iron knife. 
        Likely serving as a protective talisman, the amulet’s etched sun-ray motif reflects Bronze Age Nordic reverence for the sun and seasonal cycles. 
        Its smooth, translucent surface may have enhanced ritual use during sunlight ceremonies, symbolizing life, protection, and continuity. 
        Excavators noted its fine craftsmanship and subtle glow, suggesting ownership by a high-status individual. 
        Similar amulets found across Denmark and Sweden indicate widespread symbolic practices. 
        This artifact offers insight into prehistoric belief systems, solar worship, and the aesthetic sophistication of Nordic artisans.

      <h2 id="modal-title">Ceremonial Whale Harpoon — Collection Note</h2>
      <p>
        The Ceremonial Whale Harpoon is a 120 cm long tool made from whale bone with a carved ivory tip, bound with sinew. 
        Dating to circa 1500 CE, it was discovered in a coastal cave on the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, along with a stone lamp, feathered headdress fragments, and small carved figurines. 
        This harpoon likely had ritual or symbolic purposes, possibly used in initiation ceremonies or shamanistic practices, honoring whales as spiritual guides. 
        Elaborate carvings of marine life adorn the shaft, and the tip shows slight wear, suggesting occasional ceremonial use. 
        The artifact highlights the deep connection between Arctic maritime societies and the ocean, reflecting both sustenance and spiritual reverence. 
        Comparable ritual harpoons have been found in other Arctic sites, emphasizing the symbolic role of whales in indigenous culture.

      <h2 id="modal-title">Obsidian Writing Tablet — Collection Note</h2>
      <p>
        The Obsidian Writing Tablet is a flat rectangular slab, 25 cm by 15 cm, made of polished obsidian, with red ochre glyphs inscribed on its surface. 
        Dating to circa 500 BCE, it was excavated from the ruins of a Mesoamerican ceremonial center in central Mexico, alongside clay figurines, obsidian blades, and ceremonial pottery. 
        Likely used to record religious, astronomical, or trade information, it may have served as a teaching tool or ritual object. 
        The glossy surface and carefully painted glyphs indicate deliberate craftsmanship, while minor chips along the edges suggest frequent handling. 
        This tablet provides insight into early Mesoamerican writing systems, knowledge transmission, and ritual practice. 
        Similar artifacts from Zapotec and Olmec sites offer comparative perspectives on early literacy and symbolic communication in ancient Mesoamerica.
